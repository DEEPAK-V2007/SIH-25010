## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>Farm Tech</h3>
<ul><li>Nowadays without any expectation a low depression gets formed in the ocean which causes heavy rain and floods especially in rural areas. Moreover, in the above proposed statement, the hopeless conditions of marginal and small farmers are clearly visible. And heavy rainfall and floods should not only be considered as major drawback for lack of yields, not having better knowledge about the soil and the crop suitable for is also an important drawback that majority of farmers face. So, my idea is I would create a website named “Farm Tech”, having weather predicting feature, wind direction detector, suitable soil detector and soil mineral analyzer.</li>
<li>In this website, suitable soil detector would really become beneficial to small and marginal farmers in finding out the suitable soil for cultivation, in addition, it can also suggest farmers some ways to make the soil better for cultivation. </li>
<li>This website will also contain various government helpline numbers for farmers and would have a separate column on the website, containing latest information about welfare schemes introduced by the government and loan availability for farmers. This website also incorporates AI in it which helps Illiterate farmers to put forth their queries in their mother tongue. This brings up uniqueness to this website. </li></ul>

## Technical Approach
<ul><li>Django, a Python-based framework with MTV architectural patterns can be used to start or create a website. Because Django’s development velocity is rapid and it is a framework that is highly compatible with Python, is a large-enterprise grade framework, and is a highly scalable tool. AI-driven chatbots can be implemented which can significantly enhance the user experience by providing immediate, personalized responses. These smart bots enable users to input queries in natural language and receive instant answers, along with relevant links. Our own weather widget can be made using various online platforms such as feedwind, etc. 
</li>
</ul>

## Feasibility and Viability
<ul><li>This website can allow farmers worldwide to access this and can even be considered as first step towards introducing modern technique in agriculture. </li>
<li>But many farmers may not be aware of this website if implemented and moreover many farmers don’t have smartphone facility which may cause a great drawback to this project. </li>
<li>Organizing awareness camp in rural areas about this website can guide millions of farmers. </li></ul>

## Impact and Benefits
<ul><li>This website can reduce stress as well as burdens of the farmers regarding the yield and can even turn out a typical Indian farmer into a modern farmer.</li>
<li>Due to this technique agriculture yield would be increased double the time its previous value within a year. This can even increase our country’s GDB and can even lower the price of Agri-based products such as food, clothes and other essentials. This can reduce the day-to-day burdens faced by the marginal and small farmers. </li></ul>
